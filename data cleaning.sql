--  Data cleaning process 
-- 1. check for duplicates and remove any
-- 2. standardize data and fix errors
-- 3. Look at null values and see what 
-- 4. remove any columns and rows that are not necessary - few ways

-- 1  remove duplicates 
SELECT company, industry, total_laid_off,`date`,
		ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
			PARTITION BY company, industry, total_laid_off,`date`) AS row_num
	FROM 
		world_layoffs.layoffs_staging;
-- will be using above as sub query 

SELECT *
FROM (
	SELECT company, industry, total_laid_off,`date`,
		ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
			PARTITION BY company, industry, total_laid_off,`date`
			) AS row_num
	FROM 
		world_layoffs.layoffs_staging
) duplicates

	row_num > 1; 
    
-- let's just look at oda to confirm
SELECT *
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging

-- it looks like these are all legitimate entries and shouldn't be deleted. We need to really look at every single row to be accurate

-- these are our real duplicates 


-- changing column name for funds_raised 
ALTER TABLE  world_layoffs.layoffs_staging
CHANGE COLUMN funds_raised funds_raised_millions varchar(100);

SELECT *
FROM (
	SELECT company, location, industry, total_laid_off,percentage_laid_off,`date`, stage, country, funds_raised_millions,
		ROW_NUMBER() OVER (

			) AS row_num
	FROM 
		world_layoffs.layoffs_staging
) duplicates
WHERE 
	row_num > 1;

-- these are the ones we want to delete where the row number is > 1 or 2or greater essentially

-- now you may want to write it like this:
WITH DELETE_CTE AS 
(
SELECT *
FROM (
	SELECT company, location, industry, total_laid_off,percentage_laid_off,`date`, stage, country, funds_raised_millions,
		ROW_NUMBER() OVER (

			) AS row_num
	FROM 
		world_layoffs.layoffs_staging
) duplicates
WHERE 
	row_num > 1
)
DELETE

;

-- the above query will give error because the above cte is not updatable so we need to create another stagging table


WITH DELETE_CTE AS (
	SELECT company, location, industry, total_laid_off, percentage_laid_off, `date`, stage, country, funds_raised_millions,

	FROM DELETE_CTE
) AND row_num > 1;

-- one solution, which I think is a good one. Is to create a new column and add those row numbers in. Then delete where row numbers are over 2, then delete that column
-- so let's do it!!

ALTER TABLE world_layoffs.layoffs_staging ADD row_num INT;


SELECT *

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS layoffs_staging2;
CREATE TABLE `world_layoffs`.`layoffs_staging2` (

UPDATE layoffs_staging2 t1

-- and if we check it looks like Bally's was the only one without a populated row to populate this null values
SELECT *

ORDER BY industry;


-- we also need to look at 

SELECT *

-- everything looks good 




-- Let's also fix the date columns and total_laid_off columns:
SELECT *

-- we can use str to date to update this field
UPDATE layoffs_staging2
SET `date` = STR_TO_DATE(`date`, '%m/%d/%Y');

-- now we can convert the data type properly
ALTER TABLE layoffs_staging2
MODIFY COLUMN `date` DATE;

ALTER TABLE layoffs_staging2
MODIFY COLUMN `total_laid_off` int;

SELECT *
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2;





-- 3. Look at Null Values
--  there are empty spaces or blank space in total_laid_off and percentage_laid_off column 
--  converting all blank spaces into null
UPDATE world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
SET total_laid_off = NULL
WHERE total_laid_off  = '';

UPDATE world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
SET percentage_laid_off = NULL

-- 4. remove any columns and rows we need to

SELECT *
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
WHERE total_laid_off IS NULL;
SELECT *
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
WHERE percentage_laid_off IS NULL;


SELECT *
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
WHERE total_laid_off IS NULL

-- Delete Useless data we can't really use

SELECT * 
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2;

ALTER TABLE layoffs_staging2
DROP COLUMN row_num;
